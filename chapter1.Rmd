# About the project

The course looks fantastic. I have plenty of experience in R, Rstudio, git, and 
GitHub, which are the main tools of my daily work. With this course I hope to
not only get hands on with the selection and application of various statistical 
techniques, but also gain a better outlook on the best practices to 
visualize and share data.
